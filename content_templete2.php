            <h1>Protect Mobile Apps</h1>
            <p>- jason winter</p>
            <section class="block">
                <p>Automated purchasing bots, also known as "sneaker bots," "click bots," "Instacart bots" and other names, are ruining the online shopping and gig economy experience for both consumers and workers. These bots can cause considerable damage to a mobile business' reputation and bottom line.

As their namesake indicates, these bots were originally developed to automate the purchase of sneakers, enabling collectors and hoarders (who will resell them at a 10x or more markup) to buy mass quantities of the latest releases and squeeze out ordinary customers. As a result, for example, when Nike releases a new shoe, it can be almost impossible for individuals to beat the bots and purchase a pair for themselves online.

But these automated transaction bots are now used for far more than just sneakers. Airlines, e-commerce and events sites, and even rideshare companies all suffer from bots that scrape information and hoard products, damaging the targeted company's brand and making it difficult for consumers to buy goods and services.

These bots are easy to get. Both the Apple App Store and Google Play provide them for downloading, along with many other websites. For example, Instacart bots are third-party apps that run alongside the legitimate Instacart app and claim the best orders immediately as they are posted on the app, making it practically impossible for human shoppers to get access to most lucrative orders.

The problem is growing. According to Imperva, bad bots made up nearly a quarter of overall website traffic in 2019. Although laptops can certainly run bots, apps are where the action is. Pew Research Center reports that 74 percent of households own a computer and 84 percent have a smartphone. But when it comes to usage, mobile dominates. More than half of worldwide Internet traffic last year came from mobile devices, and U.S. consumers spent about 40 percent more time using their smartphones than they did their desktops and laptops. </p>
 <p> An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. E-tailers can and should take a number of measures to protect their mobile apps from sneaker bot apps.

For starters, they can protect their apps so that the developers of automated transaction, or auto-clicker bots, can't install the malicious app on the same device as the good app. They can also prevent the good app from being reverse engineered, a process that allows the bot developer to understand how or where to insert the bot.

Standard security methods such as app shielding, app hardening, preventing emulators and simulators, preventing debugging, preventing overlays, obfuscation and targeted encryption can prevent the development or usefulness of sneaker bots that target a specific app. Likewise, preventing a mobile app from running on rooted or jailbroken phones can also slow down or stop sneaker bots from carrying out their predesigned ends.

The goal of adding generalized security protections inside the good mobile app is to block common pathways that sneaker bot apps and auto-clicking apps need to function. Other general methods, such as obfuscation and app shielding, a set of processes used to block tampering, running programs on behalf of the good app, make it extremely hard for developers of sneaker bots to know when or how to click and execute actions on behalf of the app.

These methods can be added to the next release of the mobile app to prevent the creation and stop the usefulness of sneaker bots. </p>
