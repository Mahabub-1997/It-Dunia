            <h1>Brave Browser Caught Redirecting URLs for Cash</h1>
            <p>John P. Mello Jr.</p>
            <section class="block">
                <p>A browser that has received plaudits for privacy protection has been exposed for redirecting Web searches to make money.

Brave, a browser with some 15 million monthly users, has been redirecting searches for cryptocurrency companies to links that produce revenue for the browser's owners through advertising affiliate programs.

Twitter user Yannick Eckl, aka "cryptonator 1337," on Saturday revealed that when he searched for Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, he was redirected to an affiliate version of the URL that profited Brave.

The controversy grew when Larry Cermak, director of research at The Block, a research, analysis and news brand in the digital asset space, began digging into Brave's code on GitHub. He uncovered more redirects to another cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, and two cryptocurrency wallet sites, Ledger and Trezor.

Brave's autocompletion of a URL to include a referrer link may be a bit dodgy.

"This is ethically questionable because it's altering the address that the user thought they were typing to one that advantages Brave -- apparently in the hope that the user will just hit 'enter' and go to Brave's version," said David Gerard, UK-based author of Attack of the 50-Foot Blockchain: Bitcoin, Blockchain, Ethereum & Smart Contracts.

"This is what's called a 'dark pattern' in interface design -- one that tries to trick the user into doing things purely for the advantage of the vendor," he told TechNewsWorld.

Brave's failure to warn users that it was doing affiliate marketing appears to violate FTC rules in the United States and CAP rules in the United Kingdom, Gerard said.

"Not fully informing users is deceptive marketing, and so that part is clearly unethical too," he observed. </p>
                <p> In a series of tweets, Brendan Eich, CEO of Brave, acknowledged that the company had made a mistake and would correct it.

Brave was trying to build a business that puts users first by aligning the company's interests and those of its users with private ads that pay users, he explained.

"But we seek skin-in-game affiliate revenue, too. This includes bringing new users to Binance & other exchanges via opt-in trading widgets/other UX that preserves privacy prior to opt-in," he wrote.

"It includes search revenue deals, as all major browsers do," Eich continued. "When we do this well, it's a win for all parties. Our users want Brave to live."

The autocomplete default was inspired by search query clientid attribution that all browsers do, but unlike keyword queries, a typed-in URL should go to the domain named, without any additions, he explained.

"Sorry for this mistake -- we are clearly not perfect, but we correct course quickly," Eich wrote.

He denied that Brave was rewriting links clicked on Web pages as well as those typed into the address bar, tweeting "We have never & will not do any such thing."

The autocomplete function could be turned off in the browser's settings. Now that setting is turned on by default, but in the future, the default setting will be "off," Eich said. </p>
