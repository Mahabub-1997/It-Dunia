            <h1>Software Piracy Spreading With the Virus</h1>
            <p>Jack M. Germain</p>
            <section class="block">
                <p>The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has a destructive reach that goes beyond that of a highly contagious and deadly illness. It is also contributing to the rapid spread of piracy -- as in spreading illegal copies of commercial software.

Software piracy involves much more than businesses and consumers using illegal copies of computer programs. What lurks within the pirated copies is often rogue code -- malware -- that can be just as deadly to computers and users' finances.

Software companies are reporting that piracy has increased 20 to 30 percent due to COVID-19 and working from home, according to Ted Miracco, CEO of compliance and licensing management firm Cylynt.

The Software Alliance (BSA), research shows nearly 40 percent of all software used worldwide is not properly licensed and software companies are losing nearly US$46 billion a year due to unlicensed use," he told the E-Commerce Times.

More specifically, pirated software has a five-pronged consequence that its victims discover only when caught or infected, noted Miracco:

1. Remote work environments are creating a situation where hackers can breach an online fortress to seize a company's intellectual property.

2. Unemployed workers are buying pirated software over the Internet to generate income.

3. WFH employees are making illegal copies of the software they need for their jobs.

4. The ubiquity of the Internet and the wholesale move to cloud computing are not as secure as they could be.

5. Software pirates and hackers are resourceful at hiding their identities and evading anti-piracy technologies.

The practice of pirating software -- illegally using and distributing someone else's software -- has existed since the advent of commercial software. In most cases, pirating software involves the intentional bypass of software security controls, like licenses and entitlements, meant to prevent unauthorized use, according to Paul Dant, vice president for product management of security at Digital.ai. Dant is a reformed child hacker and former software pirate. </p>
                <p> Software piracy is so widespread that it exists in homes, schools, businesses, and government offices. Software piracy is practiced by individual PC users as well as computer professionals dealing wholesale in stolen applications, according to BSA.

The Software Alliance, headquartered in Washington, D.C. with operations in more than 30 countries, is an international organization representing the leading software developers and a foremost advocate for the global software industry before governments and in the international marketplace.

It generally issues a Global Software Report every two years. The last such report was published in 2018. That report found the use of unlicensed software, while down slightly over the previous two years, was still widespread. Unlicensed software is still used around the globe at alarming rates, accounting for 37 percent of software installed on personal computers -- only a two percent drop from 2016.

CIOs reported unlicensed software was increasingly risky and expensive. Malware from unlicensed software cost companies worldwide nearly $359 billion a year. CIOs disclosed that avoiding data hacks and other security threats from malware was the number one reason for ensuring their networks were fully licensed.

"Software piracy and cyberattacks continue to escalate, and so far the government has done little to protect its own programs, let alone the private sector," Miracco said. "Software companies need to take action and arm themselves with the best technological antipiracy solutions available to remain competitive and protect their assets." </p>
