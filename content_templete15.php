            <h1>Cloud Gaming Revenues</h1>
            <p> John P. Mello Jr.</p>
            <section class="block">
                <p>According to gaming experts, 2021 is shaping up to be a big year for cloud gaming.

"We are expecting a big jump in revenue from 2020 to 2021," observed George Jijiashvili, a senior analyst with Omdia and author of a report on cloud gaming released last week.

"We think consumer use of cloud gaming will reach US$4 billion, which is a growth rate of 188 percent, a massive jump from 2020," he told TechNewsWorld.

His report also predicted cloud gaming revenues would reach $12 billion by 2025.

A proliferation of cloud gaming services will be launched in 2021, which should brighten the sector's revenue picture.

"There are currently 25 cloud gaming services currently in beta globally," noted Piers Harding-Rolls, a games industry analyst with Ampere Analysis.

"Some of those will commercially launch in 2021 and drive awareness, adoption and monetization," he told TechNewsWorld.

More significantly," he continued. "Xbox has added a cloud gaming feature to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which will, if included in the market sizing, add value to the opportunity."

"I also expect Sony's service PS Now to continue growing in 2021," he added.</p>
                <p> Mark N. Vena, a senior analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, noted that despite some less than spectacular performance from Google's Stadia service, the overall cloud gaming category will continue to rise in 2021 and beyond.

"Microsoft and Sony -- to a lesser extent -- will grow the market with their forays into the cloud gaming arena with their new console launches that will occur in the holiday season, and Google will widen their library of games," he told TechNewsWorld.

"The pandemic will also continue to be a tailwind for gaming in general," he added.

Microsoft will be a big driver of cloud gaming revenue in 2021, according to analysts interviewed by TechNewsWorld.

"There are 15 million Xbox Game Pass subscribers," Jijiashvili explained. "Not all of them will be Ultimate subscribers, but a big chunk of them will. So next year, there will be several million cloud gaming players just from Xbox alone."

Kristen Hanich, an analyst with Parks Associates, noted that Microsoft has had some aggressive Game Pass promotions with the goal of bringing more attention and trial users to the offering.

"Once customers understand the value proposition of this model, many will stay and pay full price," she told TechNewsWorld. "It should be fairly easy to upsell these subscribers to Game Pass Ultimate, the cloud gaming tier." </p>
