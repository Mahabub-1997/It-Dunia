            <h1>US Cloud Gaming Subscriptions Target $3B</h1>
            <p>John P. Mello Jr.</p>
            <section class="block">
                <p>Consumer interest in cloud gaming could boost annual subscription revenues to nearly US$3 billion, a consumer research firm reported Tuesday.

According to Parks Associates, 30 percent of U.S. broadband households say they're interested in services that can deliver a Netflix experience for gaming. There is renewed interest, the research firm's report noted, in gaming services that can stream over the Internet and deliver games to multiple platforms without downloads and without taxing local processing power.

It estimated that -- based on consumer interest in cloud gaming services -- the U.S. cloud gaming market stands to generate nearly $3 billion in annual subscription revenue, with the opportunity to generate more revenue via service stacking and add-on sales, provided they're designed and targeted correctly.

"What makes cloud gaming unique is it's one service that you can access on multiple platforms," explained the author of the report, Senior Analyst Kristen Hanich.

"You can access a game on different devices without being tied to a single platform," she told TechNewsWorld.

The report, based on a survey of more than 10,000 U.S. broadband households, found that almost three quarters of them (74 percent) play video games for at least one hour a week.

Among the heads of broadband households, game playing is much higher. Close to a third (31 percent) play games under 10 hours a week, while 16 percent play between 10 and 20 hours a week and more than a quarter (27 percent) play more than 20 hours a week.</p>
                <p>"A lot of people were stuck indoors, they were looking for solutions, most of them already have a computer so why not use it to play games?" Hanich explained.

"The are lots of online stores that you can download a game from and start playing on your computer," she said.

PC gaming has been gaining ground in recent months because it's becoming more affordable, added Mark N. Vena, a senior analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy.

"AMD has expanded their presence with much more affordable, high performance CPUs and graphics cards in this space," he told TechNewsWorld.

"In addition," he continued, "there is still a perception with some users that the PC is still the best platform and produces the most immersive gaming experience."

An overall increase in PC purchases during the pandemic may have also benefited PC game sales, Vena observed.

"Laptops continue to be growing as a more affordable platform for PC gaming, as they've grown in power and performance," he noted. </p>
