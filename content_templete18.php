            <h1>Foldable Razr, Motorola Makes Bid for Old Glory</h1>
            <p>John P. Mello Jr.</p>
            <section class="block">
                <p>Motorola on Monday began taking orders for its US$1,499 Razr foldable smartphone. Units are expected to start shipping on Feb. 6.

Motorola made its mark on the mobile handset business with the original Razr, introduced in 2004, which ushered in the era of flip phones.

The new Razr is a flip phone, too, but with a foldable display. The 6.2-inch OLED screen folds in half to create a compact package that comfortably fits in a shirt pocket.

That's a departure from the recent crop of foldable phones that expand from phones to tablets.

"A strong point of the Razr is that it's actually a folding phone," said Frank E. Gillett, principal analyst at Forrester Research, a market research company headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

"It's a phone that shrinks in size when you fold it," he told TechNewsWorld. "Many of the competitors are really folding tablets that shrink to phone size when you fold them. " 
In addition to its foldable screen, the new Razr, which comes with Android 9 Pie, has a second, 2.7-inch, glass-covered OLED screen on the outside of the phone. That display shows notifications and music controls, and has access to a selfie mode.

A concern about foldable phones has been fragility -- especially after Samsung had to halt shipments of its Galaxy Fold last spring, after reviewers reported issues with its display. Motorola expressed confidence about the Razr's screen, though, asserting it will last for the average lifespan of any smartphone.

Nevertheless, it has warned consumers not to get the phone too wet -- even though it has an internal nano-coating for splash resistance. If it does get wet, it should be dried immediately with a soft cloth.</p>
                <p> The Razr is a unique mix of classic and current handset designs that utilizes thoroughly modern materials, Pund-IT's King told TechNewsWorld.

"It also demonstrates that Motorola isn't afraid to take risks and stand apart from the crowd," he added.

One of the challenges facing Motorola is that it's not a well-known brand in smartphones, Forrester's Gillett pointed out. "They aren't one of the big brands in phones as they were before the rise of smartphones."

Part of the new Razr's appeal is its connection to the old Razr.

"Motorola is trying to get to a place where the market is looking at the company as it did in the old days -- as an innovator, rather than part of a large Chinese commodity phone maker," Gold explained.

"In the last few years, Motorola has almost been invisible," he continued. "They haven't had anything that people would write home about. They became like BlackBerry -- irrelevant in the market place." </p>
