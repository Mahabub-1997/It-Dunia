            <h1>Facebook Rumble Over Game streaming</h1>
            <p>John P. Mello Jr.</p>
            <section class="block">
                <p>Apple's "Walled Garden" was built to protect consumers from malicious applications, but it can also protect the company from competition, as Microsoft and Facebook discovered recently.

Late last week, Apple refused to allow Microsoft to offer its xCloud streaming gaming app for iOS and iPadOS at the Apple App Store. At the same time, it approved a scaled-down version of Facebook's gaming app, sans streaming gaming, into the store.

Microsoft's xCloud service is slated to be launched next month. It's designed to bring console-quality gaming to mobile devices.

"Apple isn't directly competing in the cloud gaming space yet, but their Arcade product could be positioned there in the future, and they may be trying to keep competition away," Eric Abbruzzese, a senior analyst with ABI Research, told TechNewsWorld.

"This is protectionism of Apple services," added Michael Goodman, director for digital media at Strategy Analytics.

"They're hiding behind the App Store guidelines, which are being applied incorrectly to Microsoft's gaming service," he told TechNewsWorld. </p>
                <p> Apple may be a little overprotective of consumers when it comes to games because it has been burned by abuse of in-game purchases by developers.

In 2013, Apple paid out millions to settle a class-action lawsuit stemming from unauthorized, in-game purchases made by minors. In 2014, it coughed up US$32 million over the same issue after a run-in with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission; and this year, it was hit with another lawsuit over the legality of "loot box" in-app purchases, which gave gamers randomized digital awards.

"In the mobile gaming world, in-game purchases can be a valid concern," Goodman said. "But xCloud isn't bringing mobile games to Apple. It's bringing console, AAA-titles to handheld devices. These are not fly-by-night developers."

Protecting consumers has legal and public relations weight, acknowledged Lewis Ward, the research director for gaming at IDC. "But let's be clear," he told TechNewsWorld, "Apple has chosen not to allow music stores on iOS basically since iTunes got started, and it's following the same policy on third-party apps that will effectively compete with the App Store from a game delivery perspective."

"There's no way you can tell me they're not picking and choosing battles that are significant revenue contributors to the company," he said. "That's the unmistakable pattern." </p>
