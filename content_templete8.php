            <h1>Macs Move to Apple Silicon </h1>
            <p>John P. Mello Jr.</p>
            <section class="block">
                <p>Apple's 2020 Worldwide Developers Conference will probably be known for two things: it was the first time the forum was staged virtually, and it's when Apple announced it would start making Macs based its own processor designs.

"Today is a truly historic day for the Mac," Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the virtual keynote presentation.

"Now it's time for a huge leap forward for the Mac, because today is the day we're announcing that the Mac is transitioning to our own Apple silicon." Apple noted during its presentation that it expected machines with the new chip to be entering the market by the end of the year and the transition would take two years.

During that time, it revealed it would continue to make Intel-based machines, while offering software to enable programs written for those computers to run on Apple silicon Macs.

Apple's transition plan is very similar to what it did when it moved from the Power PC chip in 2005 to Intel, observed Ross Rubin, principal analyst with Reticle Research, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City.

"They're supporting both architectures for some period of time and having Rosetta for emulation of the old architecture," he told TechNewsWorld.

He added, though, today's state of affairs is very different from when Apple switched to Intel.

"Back then, the Mac was Apple's entire business," he said. "Now it's just a small part of Apple's business."

"Now it's less a bet-the-company decision and more of get the Mac on the same playing field that they use for their other platforms, the iPhone and iPad, and allowing greater cross-pollination of those platforms than they've allowed in the past," he added. </p>
                <p> The transition period is a lengthy one and could create uncertainty among Mac shoppers, observed Bob O'Donnell, founder and chief analyst with Technalysis Research, a technology market research and consulting firm in Foster City, Calif.

He added that Apple's announcement also left some unanswered questions about the new machines.

"What we don't know is what the real-world performance is going to be and what the real-world battery life is going to be," he told TechNewsWorld. "And there are other questions, such as will external GPUs be supported and will the new CPU support legacy device drivers, which was a problem during the last transition."

Kevin Krewell, a principal analyst in the San Jose, Calif. offices of Tirias Research, a high-tech research and advisory firm, maintained pushing Intel-based Macs for the next two years will be a tough sell for Apple.

"If you know that Apple is migrating to ARM, unless you're a diehard Intel fan and you have something you need to run on an x86 platform, you'd be hard pressed to buy an Intel-based Mac in the coming two years," he told TechNewsWorld.

He added that one thing Apple is getting right during this transition is enlisting Adobe's support of the transition from day one.

During the previous transition, he explained, "For a long time, you had to run Photoshop on Rosetta, and it performed really badly." </p>
